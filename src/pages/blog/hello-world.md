# Hello, Terminal World!

Welcome to my terminal-themed blog! This is a sample post to demonstrate the markdown formatting capabilities.

## Basic Terminal Commands

Here are some common commands you might use:

```bash
$ ls -la           # List all files with details
$ cd blog/         # Change to blog directory
$ vim new-post.md  # Create/edit a new post
```

## Text Formatting

You can use various markdown features:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- `inline code` for commands
- [Links](https://example.com) to other resources

### Code Blocks

Here's a Python example:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Terminal User")
```

> Note: This is a blockquote that you can use for important notes or quotes.

Feel free to explore around. More posts coming soon!
